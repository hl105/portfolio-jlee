# Motivation

I want to build a social media app where people can collaborate on posts “diary style.” What are some ways people post on social media, and how do they usually share content with their friends/family?

# Interview 

## Interview Report

From my first interview, I found that one of the main reasons the interviewee used Instagram was not because of the posting feature, but because of the 24-hour disappearing feature. That reduces the burden of finding the “perfect” content to post, because it will disappear anyway. Another reason is the chat feature on the application, where they could easily send their friends what they are doing right now. They also mentioned that on the app, they spent a lot of time not posting, but rather looking at other people’s content on the algorithmic suggested content on the reels page. They interact with their friends by “silently sending them reels without any additional text” frequently, which is a method to redistribute viral content. However, at the same time, they expressed their dissatisfaction with the algorithmically curated page as it made them feel “unproductive” and “[like] it takes up too much time in my life.” When comparing the social media platforms they have used before, they emphasized that while many of their friends have Snapchat accounts, they rarely use it and post on Instagram stories instead, as to him it feels like “you can use all the same features on Instagram” and people use it more. Throughout the interview, they smiled when mentioning how they interacted with their friends on the platform: sending images from a vacation trip to their friends, sending relatable reels in the group chat, or posting on their private story.

From my second interview, I saw some answers that overlapped with the first interview. An example would be when they stopped using a social media app, it was because their friends had migrated to a newer app where there were more people. This was also the case for the first interview. They also expressed their frustration with the “infinite scrolling” on the algorithmically curated page, as it kept them on the app which was “unproductive.” However, there were also new points that the second interviewee brought up. During the interview, they realized by having a public profile, a close friends circle within that profile, a finsta (friends Instagram) private profile, and a close friends circle within that private profile, they were essentially “curating a smaller list of people” to share their content with. They also brought up the point that they post “when the photo is perfect” and thus they wait until the end of an event or vacation to post a “photo dump” of exactly 9 photos and 1 video that they have carefully selected. They also were on Twitter and Messenger, for different reasons. Their Twitter account was for algorithmically curated purposes only, with 0 followers and 0 following. Their Facebook account only still exists because of Messenger, as they have moved on to Instagram for facing content but many of the group chats still remain in Messenger.

# Design Opportunites

- Need a feature where users can easily share their everyday lives instead of only offering long diary options
    - A short post section where the content disappears within 24 hours
    - Helps users reduce the burden of creating “perfect” content that will stay on their page forever unless they manually delete it
- users can join spaces where they share an interest and contribute to a shared theme
    - I plan to modify my app into a music-social media app, where one can share their memories associated with the songs they are currently listening/listening to
    - users can directly add their posts to an album or a song
    - Motivation behind this is that I’ve seen people post a whole essay on Youtube playlists, and people reacting to it saying this really helped comfort them or that they had a similar experience
    - I’ve also seen friends who curate their Spotify page, but who actively looks for someone else’s Spotify page?
- An archive  (my page), but make it easy to search for a theme, mood, place, or day
    - The interviewees  have both expressed that they usually scroll on their photos app to remember a specific event
    - Listening to a song makes me instantly remember what I was doing when I listened to this song so many times, so what if I try linking them together with a song - diary mashup?
