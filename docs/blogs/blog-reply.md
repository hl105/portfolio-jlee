# Response to Emily’s blog post

Emily went back to the very beginning of Wednesday’s lecture, revisiting the first two questions Lyle asked us — “How positive has internet affected you as an individual?” and  “How positively has the internet affected society?” She understands the complexity of this question, and I agree that it was almost impossible to describe the impact from 0 to 5. But on the count of one, two, three, we all raised our hands, and I was fascinated by the scores varied for everyone in the room — for example, I had 4 as an answer to the second question, whereas the student in front of me had 1. Like Emily explains in her blog post, there are positive and negative sides to all inventions. Fireworks became rockets. AI is being used to identify targets in the military. Like the quote “directoin is more important than speed” suggests, how we choose to innovate a creation is up to us. This got me thinking — if we are dissatisfied with certain aspects of the internet? How are we trying to address and fix them? What are some missed design opportunities at the start of the internet that would have resulted in a different world today?

An article I came across, titled “The Internet could be so good. Really” asks this very question. Written by Deb Roy, a professor at the MIT Media Lab and also the director of the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, writes about how he discusses often with his collegues about “how to make an internet a better, a more productive place.” He criticizes the current top social media platforms for not being a platform for “social connections,” but rather a place to generate ad revenue by keeping people on the app as much as possible. An 2023 article published on the MIT Tecnology Review, titled “How to fix the internet,” also focuses on how the social media platforms chose a business model with the goal to “deliver highly sophisticated targeted ads … [that] demands attention [from users] above all else.” This connected back to the business model design we were introduced to during lecture. Lyle asked us to think of how we can align economic incentives are structurely aligned with the ethical values with the plastic can holder example. Could we do the same for social media platforms? How can we create a decentralized social media platform that benefits not only the investors of the product, but also maximizes the benefits of the users so that we can innovate the internet in a better direction?
