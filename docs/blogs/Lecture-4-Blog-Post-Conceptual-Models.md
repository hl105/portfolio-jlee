# Lecture 4 Blog Post Conceptual Models

After Monday’s class, I looked into examples where the conceptual model does not align with the user’s mental model. 

## Conceptual Model Review

- conceptual model is a “representation designers create to convey a system’s functionality and behavior.”
- A mental model “represents users’ beliefs and assumptions about that system” [1].
- An example we saw in class was how `Backblaze Backup` ’s actual backup system does not match the user’s intuition when they look at the interface.
- User-centered design:
	- designer shapes the user interface to project concepts
	- concepts are psychological
- Concept-based design:
	- designer shapes the concepts itself
	- concepts are computational

## Examples


### Goodnotes Trash

- When I clicked the `trash` button, I thought it meant the page would be gone forever as I did not realize the page would be moved to the trash bin. Later, I learned the Goodnotes does not automatically empty the trash which mean that I did not have to rewrite my whole page thinking the page was gone.  A better design decision might have been `move to trash` , implying that the file will exist in the trash rather than being permanently deleted. Also, the trash is in the `settings` tab, instead of the sidebar where all the tabs/menus are. So it is very easy to think trash does not exist!

### Installing Software

- A common problem I encounter when working at the Computing Help Desk is people begin confused when trying to download software. Take chrome, for instance. When the user clicks on the blue `download chrome` option, they are expecting the colorful chrome icon to appear on their screen. However, what they get instead is a .dmg file that they need to manually click open, then follow instructions to successfully move the application to the applications folder. I’ve seen a lot of cases where users keep downloading the file over and over thinking there is something wrong with the downloaded file, whereas the problem was in opening and following the steps in the installer.

### Papercut Printer

- Papercut is the default printer at Wellesley College, and every year confused first years come by at the Help Desk asking why the printer hasn’t released anything when they clicked print. This could be prevented by explicitly saying that printing is a `two-step` process instead of the normal click print → paper comes out step we usually think of when printing.

It’s interesting to think about how a small design decision could influence users in so many ways. I guess this is why it’s important to do multiple rounds of user testing and listen to what they think a certain feature does before rolling the products out!
